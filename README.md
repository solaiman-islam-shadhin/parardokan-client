## 🔐 Security Model

1. All protected routes require a Firebase ID Token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. Backend verifies token using Firebase Admin SDK
3. User role is loaded from MongoDB and checked per endpoint
4. Roles are locked after registration — cannot be changed through the normal flow
5. Customers cannot access shopkeeper endpoints and vice versa
6. Shop ownership is verified before allowing updates
